# Bhashini-ASR-MT-TTS
Pipeline to call and use ASR, MT, and TTS from BHASHINI 

Login/signUp to https://bhashini.gov.in/ulca/user/login there if go in profile you can see your UserID and you can also generate the ULCA API Key.

Here https://bhashini.gitbook.io/bhashini-apis You can get the complete Documentation to use ASR,TTS and MT.

Here You just have to get your userId and ulcaApiKey and paste it in functions provided , and call ASR_compute_call , nmt_compute_call and tts_compute_call to use it.



Pipeline for ASR, MT, and TTS Using BHASHINI

This repository provides a streamlined pipeline to call and use ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), MT (Machine Translation), and TTS (Text-to-Speech) services from BHASHINI.

Prerequisites

BHASHINI Account:

Sign up or log in at BHASHINI.

Navigate to your profile to retrieve your UserID and generate the ULCA API Key.

Documentation Reference:

Access the complete API documentation here.

Features

This repository simplifies the usage of BHASHINIâ€™s APIs by:

Providing functions to seamlessly integrate ASR, MT, and TTS.

Enabling direct calls to the APIs with minimal setup.

Getting Started

Setup

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Add your UserID and ULCA API Key:

Open the provided configuration file or script.

Paste your credentials into the designated fields.

Example:

USER_ID = "your-user-id"
ULCA_API_KEY = "your-ulca-api-key"

Usage

ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)

Convert speech into text by calling:

from your_script_name import asr_compute_call
response = asr_compute_call(audio_file_path)
print(response)

MT (Machine Translation)

Translate text from one language to another using:

from your_script_name import nmt_compute_call
response = nmt_compute_call(text, source_language, target_language)
print(response)

TTS (Text-to-Speech)

Generate speech from text with:

from your_script_name import tts_compute_call
response = tts_compute_call(text, language)
print(response)
